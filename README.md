Research Title: Filtering Prompt Tuning to Avoid Further Training

This project is concerned around refining the supervised learning model with prompt tuning, aiming to improve accuracy of the LLM by using a gate that predicts the quality/usability of soft prompts so that no further training is needed.

I'm currently trying to reproduce the Prompt Tuning v2 from Liu et al., (2021), which can be found here: https://github.com/THUDM/P-tuning-v2 
See my fork of this paper here, where I've changed up their code a bit to fit our experiments:
